# Remote-Work-Wellbeing-Tracker
This Web Application Tracks Digital Well Being of Remote Workers and Help Them To Maintain Healthy Lifestyle

We propose the development of a website or app that tracks key aspects of remote worker wellbeing, including physical activity, screen time, breaks, and social interaction. The system will provide personalized reminders to encourage regular movement, scheduled breaks, and social check-ins. It will offer analytics and visualizations to help users understand their habits and adjust them for better balance. The platform will also integrate with wearables and other health tracking tools to provide real-time data and actionable insights, ultimately promoting healthier and more productive remote working environments.
